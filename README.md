## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- JS Modularization
- JSON data
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)- CSS framework
- [Anime Js](https://animejs.com/) - JS library
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Internet Icon Library and Framework

### What I learned

I learnt how to use css grid effectively as well as add animation using vanilla JS. I also learnt some new es6 JS concept such as getBoundClients(), scroll(), scrollBy(), scrollTo(), JS modules, literal templates, map etc. I also learnt building some custom elements (popups) from scratch and making reuseable components.

### Continued development
To improve more on JS animation, learn more about new libraries like animejs in other to use its full power.
